### Grace Hopper

-   When she recommended that a new programming language be developed
    using entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that
    \[she\] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand
    English."

-   In 1952 invented the first compiler

-   Known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0

-   Other languages she invented included MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC

--

### COBOL

-   In 1959 developed COBOL, a derivative of FLOW-MATIC

-   Hopper's belief was that programs should be written in a language
    that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in
    languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages)

-   COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date
